# Self-Driving-Car
Using OpenCV and Raspberry Pi assembled an RC car and designed software to detect road lanes on a miniature track with
road signs and traffic lights and implemented lane keeping. Currently in the process of collecting image data to train a
Convolutional Neural Network designed to support lane keeping and object detection usign Deep Learning.
