# Self-Driving-Car
## Overview
Using OpenCV and Raspberry Pi assembled an RC car and designed software to detect road lanes on a miniature track with
road signs and traffic lights and implemented lane keeping. Currently in the process of collecting image data to train a
Convolutional Neural Network designed to support lane keeping and object detection using Deep Learning.
## Test run

## Known limitations
- The lighting of the environment can affect performance of the line detection model due to variations in color saturation.
- The RC car model did not have a servo. Integrating a servo would greatly improve the car's maneuverability and would stabalize the lane detection model.
